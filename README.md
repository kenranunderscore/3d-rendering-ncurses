# Playing with curses in Nim

There's an awesome [playlist on
youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgvLfR2zG3g&list=PLg4mWef4l7Qzxs_Fa2DrgZeJKAbG3b7ue)
by KayOS code that aims to create a 3D rendering engine using
`ncurses`.  I'm trying to follow along using the Nim programming
language.  But I don't think I'll program all the linear algebra myself,
as there's already [the vmath
library](https://github.com/treeform/vmath) for Nim.
